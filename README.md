# NamelessMC Installer
One-command installer for NamelessMC, a popular open-source forum software

## Supported Operating systems
I have only tested the installer on Ubuntu 22 & Ubuntu 24 but it will most likely work on any (modern) Ubuntu or Debian version.


# How to get started
### Simply run the script command:
Using curl:
```curl -O https://nameless-installer.auri.lol/nameless-installer.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh```

Using wget
```wget https://nameless-installer.auri.lol/nameless-installer.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh```

**Do not run both, run whichever one you like better; I suggest using curl (the first one)**
